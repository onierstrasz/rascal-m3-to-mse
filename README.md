# Test Repos

The test cases require you to load the following project into eclipse:

* https://github.com/onierstrasz/p2-SnakesAndLadders.git


Other examples are the rascal-eclipse project and the rascal project itself.

* https://github.com/cwi-swat/rascal-eclipse
* https://github.com/cwi-swat/rascal

To avoid confusion with the rascal implementation, these should be renamed "rascal-clone" and "rascal-eclipse-clone".
